When referencing cryptocurrency, it is often compared to the “Wild West” or the “dot com bubble”, in the sense that valuations for disruptive technology are based on speculation.

Some of the core metrics companies in this domain use to measure success are: Acquisition Metrics, Activation Metrics, Retention Metrics, Referrals, Revenues, Marketing Metrics, Technical Metrics. 

The company is showing great signs of growth based on most metrics, although more data is needed to determine metrics such as Retention, due to the company’s infancy. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?

Blockfi is more active in social media and is attracting more customers to its platform because of its accessibility. 

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

I would suggest that the company implement a way to transact outside of Blockfi with fiat or stablecoin/Crypto. For example being able to pay rent or car payments, etc. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
	
If they offered a complete banking service there would be no need to convert money back to Fiat into a bank. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
	
They need to be able to settle transactions through stable coins like, USDG/USDT/USDC, for real world use. Right now the app is only used as a savings account with a two day withdrawal time. 





* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
	
These technologies are appropriate for the solution because they would use the second largest crypto by market cap’s network to settle transactions. Which would impart trust and maximize adoption.
